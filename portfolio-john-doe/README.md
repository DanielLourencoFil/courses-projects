CSS Portfolio website
This website was coded as an exercise proposed in "HTML&CSS Tutorial and Projects Course 2022 (Flexbox&Grid)" course by John Smilga.

Here I preset my own version of the code developed by the instructor. I coded before the instruction and at the end made some changes and improvements based on the instruction.
